Due to GitHub's file size limitations and some upload errors, I was unable to push certain large files directly to the repository. Instead, I have uploaded a ZIP file containing those files.

🛠 How to Use
Download the ZIP file from the repository.
Unzip the file using any extraction tool:
On Windows: Right-click → Extract All
On macOS/Linux: Use the command:
sh
Copy
Edit
unzip filename.zip
Move the extracted files to their respective locations as required.
⚠️ Why This ZIP File?
GitHub restricts files larger than 100MB, and some of my files exceeded this limit.
Using Git LFS initially caused errors, so I opted for this method instead.
If you encounter any issues, feel free to raise an issue or contact me. 😊

Best,
