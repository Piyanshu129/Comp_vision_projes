## 📌 Important Notice  
Due to **GitHub's file size limitations** and some upload errors, I was unable to push certain large files directly. Instead, I have uploaded a **ZIP file** containing those files.  

### 🛠 How to Use  
1. **Download the ZIP file** from the repository.  
2. **Unzip the file** using any extraction tool:  
   - On **Windows**: Right-click → Extract All  
   - On **macOS/Linux**: Run the command:  
     ```sh
     unzip yolo.zip
     ```  
3. **Move the extracted files** to their respective locations as required.  

### ⚠️ Why This ZIP File?  
- GitHub restricts files **larger than 100MB**, and some files exceeded this limit.  
- Using **Git LFS** initially caused errors, so I opted for this method instead.
